### Data Dictionary - Human Activity Recognition

**SUBJECT**  
This is the person who did the activity.  
**Range**: [1, 30]
                
**ACTIVITY**  
This is the kind of activity the subject did. It is also what we're trying to measure on all the other columns.  
1 Walking  
2 Walking_Upstairs  
3 Walking_Downstairs  
4 Sitting  
5 Standing  
6 Laying  
                
**EVERYTHING ELSE**  
These are the measurements of the activity. They were taken by getting the average by subject and activity.  
**Note:** I did not change the name of all the columns here. Make sure you remember that each one is an average of the mean or standard deviation.

I am not fairly familiar with each one, so I will leave this mainly blank.  
**Range:** [-1, 1]
